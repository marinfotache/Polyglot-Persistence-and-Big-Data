### Scripts, tutorials and lectures/labs recordings - `MongoDB`

Most of the references are in English, except for lectures/labs recordings (Romanian) - please watch the tutorials recommended in the [presentation (.pptx)](https://github.com/marinfotache/Polyglot-Persistence-and-Big-Data/blob/master/01%20Document%20Databases.%20MongoDB/01%20Document_DB__MongoDB.pptx)

The default OneDrive video player does not  work properly on some systems, so I would suggest downloading the `.mp4` files on your computer and watch them with `VLC Player`.
